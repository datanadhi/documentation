# Architecture Overview

Data Nadhi is a **distributed, microservices-based data pipeline platform** built for flexibility, scalability, and keeping things simple.  
This doc gives you the high-level view and links to detailed pages for each component.

---

## High-Level Architecture

Data Nadhi is made up of multiple services that can be deployed independently. They work together to ingest, process, and deliver data wherever it needs to go.

## Core Components

### Data Nadhi SDK
- Built as **language-specific SDKs** - each language gets its own repo.
- Captures logs from your app and sends them securely to the Data Nadhi Server.
- You'll need:
  - **API Key** for authentication
  - **Log Config** to decide which logs go to stdout and which go to the server
- If something fails, the SDK logs the error (if you have that enabled) after getting a failure response from the server.
- **Available SDKs:**
  - [Python SDK](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-sdk/)
- [Detailed SDK Architecture →](/docs/PoC/architecture/sdk)

---

### Data Nadhi Server
- A **Node.js-based API server** built to scale horizontally.
- What it does:
  - Validates your API Key and figures out which org/project you're working with
  - Checks if the pipeline you want is actually active
  - Pushes log events to Temporal's `task-q` queue
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-server/)  
- [Detailed Server Architecture →](/docs/PoC/architecture/server)

---

### Data Nadhi Main Worker
- Grabs the workflow config for each pipeline and sets it up in a way that can be traversed.
- Figures out which node to start from and pushes tasks to Temporal's `task-q-transform`.
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-temporal-worker/)  
- [Detailed Overview →](/docs/PoC/architecture/temporal/main-worker)

---

### Data Nadhi Transformation Worker
- Goes through the workflow config and applies transformations to your data.
- Handles different types of nodes:
  - `transform` nodes for changing data
  - `conditional-branch` nodes for routing
  - `end` nodes for pushing the transformed data to Temporal's `task-q-destination`.
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-temporal-worker/)  
- [Detailed Overview →](/docs/PoC/architecture/temporal/transformation-worker)

---

### Data Nadhi Destination Worker
- Gets the destination and connector configs you've set up.
- Picks the right **destination sender engine** for the job.
- Sends your processed data to wherever it needs to go (databases, APIs, etc.).
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-temporal-worker/)  
- [Detailed Overview →](/docs/PoC/architecture/temporal/destination-worker)

## Utility Components

### Data Nadhi Dev
- Has everything you need for the **development environment** using Dev Containers.
- Includes:
  - `docker-compose` with shared storage and all the infrastructure
  - Migration scripts for **MongoDB** and **Postgres**
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-dev/)

---

### Data Nadhi Internal Server
- A lightweight server for **intermediate operations** that the UI usually handles.
- Makes testing easier when you don't have the frontend running.
- [Repository](https://github.com/Data-ARENA-Space/data-nadhi-internal-server/)

> 💡 *All components are modular and containerized, so the whole system is portable, can scale, and is ready for production.*
