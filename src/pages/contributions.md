# Contributing to Data Nadhi

Thanks for thinking about contributing! Data Nadhi is a community-driven project, and every contribution — big or small — makes a difference.

All repos are set up with **development containers (Dev Containers)**, so you can spin up a ready-to-go dev environment without worrying about dependencies or config.

## Setting Up Your Local Development Environment

Data Nadhi uses **Dev Containers**, which give you a fully-configured environment for development.  

1. **Open in VS Code:**  
   - Install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).  
   - Open the repo in VS Code. You'll get prompted to "Reopen in Container."  

2. **Inside the Container:**  
   - All dependencies are already installed.  
   - Start the server or make changes directly without worrying about your local setup.  

*Using Dev Containers keeps things consistent across contributors and cuts down setup friction.*
